# Mission Statement:
Deletes expletives and comments deemed uncivil by our Tensor Flow toxicity model in any Slack channel and sends a message to that user shaming them with a Shakespearean insult.

## Commands: 
- !leaderboard - returns a ranked count of users with the most violations
- /violations@username - admin only, returns all violations made that username
- /promote@username - admin only, promotes another user to admin role

# Group Agreement
- Standups: 9:15 in the morning, 15-30mins long.
- Take breaks every hour for 15 minutes.
- If conflict arises don't be afraid to speak up, but keep it professional.
- No cowboy coding!
